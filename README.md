![BuildStatus](https://github.com/duncan-muir/project2/workflows/project2/badge.svg?event=push)

Breadth-first search is implemented with a List for a queue, and an OrderedDict to track 
traversal and visitation. The search method returns a method when a valid end node is provided 
and a path is found; or it returns a traversal if no end node is provided.
